# Deliverables

### Group Report
1. Basics:  introduction, description of the data set, description of the deep learning network and training algorithm. 
2. Experimental setup. Describe how you are going to use the data to train and test the network. Explain how you will implement the network in the chosen framework and how you will judge the performance. Will you use minibatches? How will you determine the size of the minibatches? How will you determine training parameters (e.g., learning rate)? How will you detect/prevent overfitting and extrapolation?
3. Results
4. Conclusion:  what we learned, areas for improvement
5. References
6. Code
