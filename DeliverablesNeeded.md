### Group Report
* Basics:  introduction, description of the data set, description of the deep learning network and training algorithm. 
* Experimental setup. 
  * Describe how you are going to use the data to train and test the network. 
  * Explain how you will implement the network in the chosen framework and how you will judge the performance. 
  * Will you use minibatches? How will you determine the size of the minibatches? 
  * How will you determine training parameters (e.g., learning rate)? 
  * How will you detect/prevent overfitting and extrapolation?
* Results
* Conclusion:  what we learned, areas for improvement
* References
* Code
